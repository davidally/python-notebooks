    "<p>Instagram split their Explore system into two stages called 'the candidate generation' stage and the 'ranking' stage. They first gather 'seed' accounts that people have interacted with. In this case content that users have liked or saved media from. Usually these accounts share similar or the same interests. Then they use what are called 'embedding techniques' to identify other accounts similar to the seed accounts. Based on this aggregation Instagram is able to find media that the accounts have posted or are engaged with. With so many sources Instagram is able to agreggate thousands of candidates for a person. The system is filtered with machine learning in order to detect and filter content that violates policy or spam. Finally Instagram then takes a sample of 500 from their aggregate and sends the candidates to the ranking stage.</p>"

    "<p>The candidates are then filtered 3 times by different neural network models in order to find the highest quality content breaking down from 500 to 150, 150, to 50, and then 50 to 25. With this Instagram recommends things corresponding to a users interests but also recommends new things as well.</p>"

    "<p>The system Instagram has created works very well for the platform and needs little in the way of improvement. The main issue social media companies like Instagram face is that content that violates policy is constantly being uploaded. I would recommend if possible some sort of client-side filtering of content. Users need more input as well by being asked directly (although not intrusively) as this will make their models more accurate without much more effort on their part.</p>"
